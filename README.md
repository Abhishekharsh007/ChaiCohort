# Introduction to git and github :-

Git is a version control system VCS designed to track changes in source code and collaborate efficiently with others. It is widely used for software development due to its speed, flexibility, and support for non-linear workflows (e.g., branching and merging). This what a typical git workflow in a startup or enterprise application code could look like.

# Popular VCS Tools:
