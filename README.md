# Introduction to git and github :-

Git is a version control system VCS designed to track changes in source code and collaborate efficiently with others. It is widely used for software development due to its speed, flexibility, and support for non-linear workflows (e.g., branching and merging). This what a typical git workflow in a startup or enterprise application code could look like.

# Popular VCS Tools:
1. Git :- The most widely used DVCS; supports branching and distributed workflows.
2. Subversion (SVN) :- A CVCS used in enterprise applications.
3. Mercurial :- Another DVCS, simpler than Git in some aspects.
4. Perforce :- A CVCS often used for large-scale enterprise projects.

# Why do we need VCS?
1. Tracking Changes :- It records changes to files over time, enabling developers to see who changed what and when.
2. Collaboration :- Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
3. Branching and Merging :- Developers can create separate branches for different features or experiments and later merge them into the main project.
4. Version History :- It keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
5. Conflict Resolution :- Helps manage and resolve conflicts when multiple developers make changes to the same file.
6. Backup and Recovery :- Acts as a backup for the project.
